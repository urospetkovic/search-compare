search compare

compare between random and binary search (guess number game)

first algorithm picks a random number between two numbers. 
second one picks the middle between two numbers in a while loop.
third one picks the middle between two numbers with recursion.

binary search will always have a better average score, 
but recursion (3) needs more time.
